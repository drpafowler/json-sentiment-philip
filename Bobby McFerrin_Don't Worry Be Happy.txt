Here's a little song i wrote,

You might want to sing it note for note,

Don't worry, be happy

In every life we have some trouble,

When you worry you make it double

Don't worry, be happy



Don't worry be happy now

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head,

Somebody came and took your bed,

Don't worry, be happy



the landlord say your rent is late,

He may have to litagate,

Don't worry (small laugh) be happy,



Look at me I'm happy,

Don't worry, be happy



I give you my phone number,

When your worried, call me,

I make you happy



Don't worry, be happy



Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style,

Ain't got no gal to make you smile

But don't worry, be happy.



'cause when you worry, your face will frown,

And that will bring everybody down,

So don't worry, be happy.



Don't worry, be happy now...



Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it,

Be happy.



Put a smile on your face.

Don't bring everybody down like this



Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is,

Don't worry, be happy,

I'm not worried.
